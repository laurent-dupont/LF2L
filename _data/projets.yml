  quote: '<p>I enjoyed participating in the Green FabLab project because it helps to create a short consumer circuit by discovering the plastic filament extrusion process. We worked on the use of the Xcalibur extruder. It is an easy to use machine but with many parameters. However it was a real pleasure to work in the laboratory with teams of different horizons and cultures.</p>',

I learned to use several equiments and I could to contribute to the advencement of the FabLab. I liked the working atmosphere and I would like to thanks all the members of the team for this internship.</p>',

First of all, we learned how to use the 3D printing machines and also the scanner. After that we spent the rest of the time working in the extruder who provides the material for the printers. We learned how to do the filaments and also did a tutorial to show to everyone how to use it. For that, we made differents test and solved several problems that we found during this process.</p>',

I worked on a recycling project on thermoplastics for 3D printing. I've been to different laboratories, but some elements of the Fablab green draw attention. One such feature is its openness to the public, community citizens, teachers, researchers and students can enjoy the resources of the laboratory. It is a really comfortable environment to work with, we have the feeling that it is really producing something pertinent and solid, since the experimentation in this laboratorie is well explored",
